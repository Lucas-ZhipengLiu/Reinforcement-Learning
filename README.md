# Reinforcement-Learning
Implemented various RL algorithms. Test and compare them on both openai gym task and my designed task.

# Implemented algorithms

- Q Learning
- Policy Gradient
- Actor-critic
- Naive DQN (Deep Q-network)
- Prioritized DQN (DQN + Prioritized experience replay)
- Categorical DQN (DQN + Distributional perspective)
- Naive DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
- Prioritized DDPG (DDPG + Prioritized experience replay)


# Dependency

- Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04
- Python 3.6, 3.5
- Pytorch v0.4.1
- OpenAI Gym (Classic control)
- pybullet


# Achievements

Test and compare DQN, Prioritized DQN and Categorical DQN on OpenAI Gym CartPole-v1 task.
